### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Aaron, I'm from Cincinnati Ohio. I'm a seasoned Motion Graphic Designer acquiring new career skills at Per Scholas, exploring the world of Software Engineering to enhance my creative toolkit.

Bridging the Gap: My mission? To seamlessly unite the realms of design and code, with a particular focus on creating experiences that resonate with the end user, especially children. I thrive on breaking down barriers between function and beauty, bringing a unique perspective to the table.

I will update this page as I produce new projects, but for now check out my first game Space Invaders :space_invader:
